<p>Handsfree is a term used to describe technology that uses various features to accommodate the userâ€™s ability to communicate without using the hands. Many of these technologies are made to be used while operating a vehicle, but are often used in many other places to allow people to multi-task more effectively. Handsfree technologies use the same sorts of wireless systems used in emerging mobile device technologies and other wireless networks. The user will typically communicate with a nearby piece of hardware that sends and receives voice or other data as digital packets.</p>
